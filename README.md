# Player-Movement

This is a remake of the movement in the Titanfall Series made by Respawn Entertainment. Currently there is only Apex legends movement as the wallrunning is too janky.

Some parts are from:

Feel free to use this movement script anywhere.

You can add wallrunning by uncommenting all the lines.

# To-do
- Cleanup the code
- Make wallrunning less janky
